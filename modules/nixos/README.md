## System Configuration



## Archetypes

### Gaming

This archetype installs Steam and the Prismlauncher, a graphical user interface (KDE) and some other basic functionality.
I want to look into also setting up some factorio configs declarative later. Maybe setup Lutris to allow for some other games aswell.
Currently Steam with proton is working amazingly.

I want to change the way that the GUI is setup so I can later choose a display manager I want to use something like hyperland maybe, since i3 was what I always used before.

### Development

This is mainly just reading up on direnv and making sure I learn how to use cargo under nix so I can start my journey to learn rust again.Also getting this to work means working more on my [nixvim derivative](https://github.com/Daholli/nixvim).

### Workstation

Mainly for Office or daily stuff, libre Office, Pdf readers and the likes come to mind, also thinking about what to exclude from KDE that I dont really need installed to make sure that the installtion size stays somewhat small.

### Server

I want to try setting up a DIY NAS at home using nix and maybe a rasberry pie but there is no real concrete plan for now.

## Security

I want to learn about what (besides not being a monkey) I can to to make my system more secure. I have a lot to learn here.

## Deployment

How do I deplo my config onto new systems, and how do I safely transmit my signing key for git to other hosts

## Backups

I saw that there is a onedrive version for linux, but I feel like that is not a good solution, I should look into [syncthing](https://syncthing.net) as this one looks really interesting, but I don't want to start this until I understood all of the implications.
