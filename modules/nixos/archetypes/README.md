# Archetypes

## Gaming

This archetype installs Steam and the Prismlauncher, a graphical user interface (KDE) and some other basic functionality.
I want to look into also setting up some factorio configs declarative later. Maybe setup Lutris to allow for some other games aswell.
Currently Steam with proton is working amazingly.

## Workstation

Mainly for Office or daily stuff, libre Office, Pdf readers and the likes come to mind.

## Server

I want to try setting up a DIY NAS at home using nix and maybe a rasberry pie but there is no real concrete plan for now.

## Pi / Homeassistant
